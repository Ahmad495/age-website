**Apache AGE®** is a PostgreSQL extension that provides graph database functionality. The goal of Apache AGE is to enable users of Postgres to use graph query modeling in unison with Postgres’ existing relational model.

**Apache AGE®** is a Top-Level Project of the Apache Software Foundation since May 2022. It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

Below is a brief overview of the AGE architecture in relation to the PostgreSQL architecture and backend. Every component runs on the PostgreSQL transaction cache layer and storage layer.

\* Support for PostgreSQL 12 and 13 will be implemented in Q3. Support for PostgreSQL 14 will be added in Q4 2022.

**Apache AGE®** will be developed to be compatible with all relational DB, starting with MySQL and Maria DB.

  <p><strong>You are a volunteer</strong></p>
  <p>The role of open-source contributor for Apache AGE is a volunteer
    role. This means you are not an employee of, or contractor to, Apache
    AGE and, if you accept the role, you perform all duties on a voluntary
    basis.</p>

  <p><strong>Role description and your contribution</strong></p>
  <p>Apache AGE has recently been announced as Apache Top-Level Project by
    the Apache Software Foundation. You are welcome to contribute and
    participate through our mailing lists, issue tracker, pull requests, and
    event.</p>
  <p>For more detailed information, please visit Apache AGE website at <a
      href="https://age.apache.org/">https://age.apache.org/</a>.</p>
  <p>To show your support for Apache AGE and AGE Viewer, please subscribe
    to the Apache AGE mailing lists and join the Apache AGE
    discussion forum at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apacheage/">https://www.reddit.com/r/apacheage/</a></p>
  <br /><br />
  <p><strong>Volunteer benefits and feedbacks</strong></p>
  <p>We believe giving and receiving feedback effectively is an important
    part of communication and integral to your successful volunteering with
    us. Your supervisor may provide you a monthly performance review and we,
    at our sole discretion, may offer you paid positions based on your
    contribution.</p>
  <p>By the same token, please also bear in mind that we may exclude you
    from your ongoing projects based on our evaluation of your performance
    and contribution.</p>
  <p>As stated above you will be given an opportunity to become an Apache
    AGE project committer while volunteering with us. To become a committer,
    you should be highly motivated to solve the problem, possessing high
    attention-to-detail while making changes or writing codes, and should
    have active participation in the community.</p>
  <br /><br />
  <p><strong>Confidential information</strong></p>

    as part of, or to assist them with, their role. Confidential information
    includes any information about Apache AGE which has been designated by
    Apache AGE Project Management Committee as confidential or which is, by
    its nature, confidential or proprietary to Apache Software Foundation.
    You are not permitted to use or disclose any confidential information
    for any purpose other than the proper discharge of your duties as a
    volunteer for Apache AGE.</p>
  <br /><br />

  <p>You agree to transfer all intellectual property rights and interests
    (including copyright) in any ideas or materials you create relating to
    your provision of voluntary services to Apache AGE. You consent to the
